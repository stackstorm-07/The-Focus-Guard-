This moves away from text and into Machine Learning (ML). It’s a physical, "no-code" way to understand how AI "sees" the world.
The Concept: The "Phone-Free Zone" Detector
A model that triggers an alert (or a funny sound) if it sees a smartphone in the student's hand.
Hands-on Activity:
1. Setup: Go to Teachable Machine.
2. Training:
* Class 1 (Focusing): Sit at your desk looking at a book/laptop. Capture 50 images.
* Class 2 (Distracted): Hold your phone up as if scrolling. Capture 50 images.
3. Train & Export: Hit "Train Model."
4. The "Hack": Students can use the "Export Model" feature to a simple Javascript snippet (you can provide a template) that plays a loud "🚨 GET BACK TO WORK" sound when the "Distracted" class hits 90% confidence.
